# RAG Cost

**RAG Cost** is a free, privacy tool that helps developers and teams reduce unnecessary AI agent and LLM token usage in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

Instead of sending entire documents to language models,
RAG Cost analyzes files in advance and prepares
retrieval-optimized content to significantly reduce context size and cost.

## What the tool does

- Estimates LLM token usage before and after RAG optimization
- Highlights inefficiencies in naive document injection
- Generates agent-ready files for RAG pipelines
- Processes files temporarily (no storage, privacy-first)

## Free online tool
